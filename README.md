<h2>Radiocarbon dates for the spread of farming and ceramics in tropical South America</h2>
<p>This library contains a dataset with 2794 radiocarbon dates from 1035 archaeological sites in lowland South America. In principle, only archaeological cultures related to the spread of polyculture agroforestry (tropical forest farming) and ceramics are represented. The dataset has been compiled and is continuously updated as part of the project ExPaND funded by the European Commission H2020 (https://amazonexpand.wixsite.com/expand).</p>
